{**Description**}
This is a simple meteo station device, able to return a new set of meteo data at each simulation step.
Implemented meteo data (with units) are:
temperature (Celsius)
humidity (%)
windspeed (m/s)
winddir (degree, 0=NORD)
pressure (hPa)
radiation (w/m2)


{**Commands**}
Beside the built-in (predefined) commands, this device implements only the "simulate" mandatory command.
Use the predefined command "getstatus" to get the meteo data at the current simulation time.

[**simulate**]
Compute a new meteo data set and store it in the device status using field names as those listed before.
input parameters:
	timestamp (integer, mandatory): the current timestamp for the simulation step
output parameters:
	the current status array
specific errors: none


{**Signals**}
Beside the built-in (predefined) signals, this device implements only the 2 mandatory signals.

(**poweron**)
Sets the power status to "on" and recomputes the meteo data at the current simulation timestamp.
input parameters: none

(**poweroff**)
Sets the power status to "off", sets the power status to zero anf freezes the meteo data until a poweron signal is given.
input parameters: none
