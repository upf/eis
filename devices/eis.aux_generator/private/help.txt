{**Description**}
This device implements a simple grid connection, able to exchange electrical power with the grid and to sell/buy energy to/from it.
It implements also different hourly buy/sell energy price plans, selectable during initialization.
It MUST be connected only to the unprotected line.


{**Commands**}
This device implements all the predefinite commands and also the "getpriceinfo" command.

[**init**]
Beside the built-in (predefined) input parameters, it requires also the "sim_price" parameter containing a valid price plan ID.

[**getpriceinfo**]
Retuns an array of available hourly price plans.
input parameters:
	none
output parameters:
	an associative array as priceplanID => plan_description
specific errors: none


{**Status Variables**}
Beside the built-in (predefined) status variables, this device has also the following relevant status variables:
	sim_price : 	current price model ID (set at initialization time)
	price_buy :		current price for buying 1 kWh of energy
	price_sell:		current price for selling 1 kWh of energy
	total_buy :		total cost for buying from the beginning of simulation
	total_sell:		total revenue for selling from the beginning of simulation
	gridstatus:		current status of the unprotected line:
					"ok" connected
					"disconnected" disconnected
					"overload" disconnected for overload
					"overgen" disconnected for overgeneration


{**Signals**}
The predefined commands "poweron" and "poweroff" correspond to connect/disconnect the unprotected line to/from the grid.
